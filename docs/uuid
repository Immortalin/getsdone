used a one way hash on the email address, obviously this makes it problematic
to retrieve the email address.  either encrypt it or keep it clear text, the
password being hashed is fine.

need to preserve the current 20 users, though i don't have a good way of
doing it automatically.

steps:

1.  purge gravatar entries
2.  keep uuid since it's required for creating tokens, or you can force
them to update email records
3.  notification to existing users to update via profile page

new users are unaffected.

the alternative is just to purge all users and start fresh, none of the users
are active and this is an alpha.
